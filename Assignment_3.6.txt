1.
Number of data nodes needed= 600 TB/ 7TB
			     =85.71 = 86 data nodes 
2.
If the block size is considered to be 100 MB (or less like iin Hadoop 1.x)then, after writing the data in only block ,it will be available for the reader .
Only the current block in which the data is being written will bot be visible to the reader.
So, if block size is less than or equal to 100 MB,then other persons can view the data or else we can cannot view the data like in hadoop 2.x
